                I am a returning student continuing to retrieve my Bachelors degree. I'm happily married with four kids. 
                I've studied abroad in Saudi Arabia and had the experience of living in such a great country contrary to what many people may assume it to be.
                My major was Islamic science and Arabic language. My future goal is to expand my skills and knowledge in fields in areas which I know I am capable in succeeding in.
                After taking a software developing course with Skillspire, I've been excited to see what my future holds.
